# Deep Learning for beginners

## Why deep learning rather than conventional machine learning

Machine learning requires alot of EDA and it cannot process complex information. Deep learning stimulates the working of the human brain, just like a human brain, deep learning provides neurons and collectively they are called a neural network.

Conventional Machine Learning cannot handle complex data. 
For example, in the case of a linear model, we will be unable to draw a best-fit line in the graph below. We can use conventional machine learning when data is not that much complex or the patterns of data are not complex.

## Simple Neural Network

Maths functions are called neurons such as Max function.
A structure of neural network is as follows: input neuron => hidden layers => output neuron
