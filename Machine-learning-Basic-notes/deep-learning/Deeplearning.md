# Deep Learning for beginners

## Why deep learning rather than conventional machine learning

Conventional machine learning requires alot of EDA and it cannot process complex information. Deep learning stimulates the working of the human brain, just like a human brain, deep learning provides neurons and collectively they are called a neural network.

In conventional Machine Learning Linear model, it cannot handle complex data. 
For example, we will be unable to draw a best-fit line in the graph below. We can use conventional machine learning when data is not that much complex.
