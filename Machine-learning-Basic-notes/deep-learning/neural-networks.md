# Neural Networks

# Regular Neural Network(ANN)
ANN(Artificial Neural Network) is the most common type of neural network. It has three types of layers: input, hidden, and output. In ANN
units from one layer are connected to another. Each connection has weights that determine the influence of one unit on another unit. As the data transfers from one
unit to another, the neural network learns more and more about the data which eventually results in an output from the output layer.

The input layer in ANN receives the input from the exetnal sources and releases it to the hidden layer, which is the second layer. In the hidden layer, each neuron recieves input from prev layer neurons, computes the weighted sum, and send it to the neurons in the next layer.

### CNN(convolution neural network)

CNN, or Convolutional Neural Network, is primarily used for computer vision tasks. It operates similar to our brain: imagine encountering a new object like a bottle. 
Like our brain, CNN first examines simple features like color, weight, and shape to understand it. Then, it progressively analyzes more complex details, 
identifying patterns along the way. In simple terms, CNN creates a basic image, gradually adding layers of complexity to recognize and understand visual information.
